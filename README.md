> _In Noxus, warriors known as Reckoners face one another in arenas where blood is spilled and strength testedâ€”but none has ever been as celebrated as Draven. A former soldier, he found that the crowds uniquely appreciated his flair for the dramatic, and his unparalleled skill with his spinning axes. Addicted to the spectacle of his own brash perfection, Draven has sworn to defeat whomever he must to ensure that his name is chanted throughout the empire forever more._

In our world (Earth Dimension 616), Draven plays the character of a rowdy agent who is taking part in the **Multi Agent Systems Rumble Tournament** held by Demacia's ruler (Praveen Paruchuri) and its chief in commander (Shreevignesh Suriyanarayanan).
